The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it is ready to meet Mr Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate, in court over his claim of electoral fraud in the Feb. 25 presidential election. Mr Bayo Onanuga, Director Media and Publicity, APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), said this in a statement on Thursday in Abuja. The statement was the APC PCC’s reaction to comments made by Obi at a news conference in Abuja. “We welcome the decision of Mr Obi to seek redress in court as an aggrieved party if he is convinced of the evidence of electoral frauds he will present before the tribunal as alleged. “Going to court is part of the electoral process and it is the most decent, statesmanlike and civilised course of action to take,” Onanuga said. He said the APC PCC saluted the decision, adding that it was better than calling supporters to the streets and instigating social unrest.

Onanuga said the 2023 Presidential and National Assembly election was one of the most transparent and peaceful elections in the history of Nigeria. He added, “It is because the process was credible that made it possible for Obi’s Labour Party to record the over six million votes it got contrary to pre-election forecasts.”
