Bola Tinubu, the president-elect, on Thursday said Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party, should not mislead “gullible” Nigerians. POLITICS NIGERIA reports that Tinubu spoke through the Chief Spokesperson of his Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo (SAN). In the press statement obtained by this newspaper, the APC chieftain refuted Obi’s claim that the Labour Party won the 2023 presidential election, adding that the former Anambra State governor is determined to “delegitimise the mandate freely given to the President-Elect by majority of Nigerians”. Tinubu’s statement reads: “We make this brief statement in reaction to the Press briefing held earlier today by the defeated candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, wherein (in his now well-acknowledged penchant for spewing falsehood) he made the outlandish claim before the world that he won the 2023 Presidential Election, but he was robbed of the victory. “Having been officially declared winner of the 2023 Presidential Election by the Independent National Electoral Commission and having received his Certificate of Return (along with his Vice-President Elect), the President-Elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu would have ignored this continuous false claims being peddled by Mr. Peter Obi and his supporters. But we recognise his motive of doing this is to simply delegitimise the mandate freely given to the President-Elect by majority of Nigerians. “Mr. Peter Obi is always quick to cite some isolated incidents of irregularities outside his strongholds that could not have SUBSTANTIALLY affected the outcome of the results in those areas, whereas he DELIBERATELY fails to comment on tons and tons of evidence circulating everywhere wherein his supporters in his strongholds engaged in thuggery, hooliganism, violence and outright falsification of figures against our Party and our supporters. He pretends to play the victim, whereas he is the greatest culprit in this game of brickbats.

He did not come even close. With his divisive rhetorics, he could not have come close. “It is also ludicrous that Mr. Peter Obi is laying claim to victory along with his new-found partner, the PDP, that is also laying claim to victory. I tweeted this morning, thus: ‘’This is the first time in my entire life that I am seeing people who came 2nd and 3rd in an exam both claiming they took first and then agreeing to protest together to the examiner to record that both of them took first, yet they are not seeing the contradiction in their actions.’’ We stand by that comment. “The President-Elect, ASIWAJU Bola Ahmed Tinubu has extended a hand of fellowship to his defeated opponents, including Mr. Peter Obi to join hands with him in nation-building. “Mr. Peter Obi should embrace that hand of fellowship and brotherhood by the President-elect as a committed patriot instead of engaging in this crass grandstanding.” .Says Nigerians don't want looters as leaders By Tom Okpe The presidential flag-bearer of the Labour Party, Peter Obi has vowed to retire the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) Atiku Abubarkar and that of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) Bola Ahmed Tinubu if elected president in the… In "Headlines" The report of Fitch Solutions Country Risk and Industrial Research predicting the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu as the winner of the 2023 election has stirred reaction.
