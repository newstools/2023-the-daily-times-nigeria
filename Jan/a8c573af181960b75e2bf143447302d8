Reacting to a story in the media yesterday alleging that the Commission raised an alarm of possible cancellation for security reasons, the chairman urged Nigerians not to reckon with any news contrary to the fact that INEC is going ahead with planned schedule for the election which is 43 days away. He reassured that as a commission, INEC is fully prepared to conduct the 2023 polls and never contemplate shifting election dates or an outright cancellation. Politicians and other Nigerians of diverse shades of opinion kicked against the alleged envisaged cancellation and cautioned the Commission to guide against any unforeseen circumstances. Prof. Yakubu made the clarification in Abuja on Wednesday while presenting Registered Voters for the 2023 Election to leadership of the 18 registered political parties at the Commission’s headquarters in Abuja. Speaking on the readiness to conduct the polls, he said at no time in the recent history of the Commission has so much of the forward planning and implementation been accomplished 43 days ahead of a General Election. “Therefore, the Commission is not contemplating any adjustment to the election timetable, let alone the postponement of the General Election. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Presidential and National Assembly elections will hold on Saturday 25th February 2023 while Governorship and State Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday 11th March 2023. “The repeated assurance by the security agencies for the adequate protection of our personnel, materials and processes also reinforces our determination to proceed. “The 2023 General Election will hold as scheduled. Any report to the contrary is not the official position of the Commission,” said Yakubu. As a further affirmation of the Commission’s readiness to conduct the 2023 General Election as scheduled, he said substantial quantities of sensitive and non-sensitive materials have already been deployed to various locations across the country. “I would like to reiterate our commitment to transparent, credible and inclusive 2023 General Election. We will continue to take every step to protect the sanctity of the votes cast by citizens and to deal with infractions, including the arrest and prosecution of persons that attempt to perpetuate illegality at Polling Units on Election Day, be they underage voters or vote buyers,” he added.
