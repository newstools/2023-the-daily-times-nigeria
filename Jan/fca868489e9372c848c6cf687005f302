A former All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council Director for the Civil Society Organization, Naja’atu Mohammed, has explained why she would not support Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, for the presidency. Naja’atu made her reasons known on Thursday while fielding questions on Arise Television’s Morning Show programme. Recall that Naja’atu resigned from her appointment with the APC and Tinubu’s campaign team a few days ago. However, Tinubu’s campaign council claimed she was sacked for being a mole in the campaign team. But while speaking further on her choice of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as her preferred candidate for the forthcoming presidential election, Naja’atu said she is choosing between a devil and the deep blue sea between Tinubu and Atiku. She said, ”I am not doing Atiku today for anything. I gave my reasons, and my reasons I said, Peter Obi is a movement, I said that. And I also said this is the first time the Nigerian youths have a voice and are coming together to form some kind of movement; it is not even about Peter Obi. This movement will outlive Mr Peter Obi. What I said is that they have a structural problem.

Despite the cult followership the North gave to Buhari, why didn’t he win? He did not win because he had structural problems and could not build bridges. It took the alliance, which he had rejected severally with the Southwest in particular, that he was able to become president; that is the only reason. And what I will also say is this, I have no luxury of time; there is no luxury of time, and that is why I said I am choosing between a devil and a deep blue sea.”
