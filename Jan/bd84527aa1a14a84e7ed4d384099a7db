…Says Tinubu Is Intimidated by Emmanuel’s achievements,  campaign coordination By Tunde Opalana The Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Organization has  berated the  Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for issuing threats of violence to the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council and Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, at the APC Campaign Rally held in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on Monday. The Campaign condemned in very strong terms the resort to threats by Senator Tinubu. It alleged that Tinubu is now trying to transfer his annoyance over his failed campaign as well as the frustration of crushing rejection by Nigerians to the PDP Presidential Campaign. The campaign pitied  Tinubu for finding it extremely difficult to handle his impending defeat, saying he is now plagued by deep-seated pains, frustration and anger against successful Nigerians which manifested in his attack on the person of Emmanuel. Campaign spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyanon Tuesday said it  is crude, to say the least, for Tinubu to have threatened Gov Emmanuel with chasing him (Emmanuel), a democratically elected governor, out of Lagos State. “Nigerians can now imagine how autocratic a Tinubu Presidency, God forbids, will turn out as vicious, disrespectful, harassing, intimidating and subduing.

The Campaign urged Tinubu to  know that Lagos State is not his fiefdom and he cannot determine who stays or whom he will chase out of Lagos. “Tinubu should accept the fact that Nigerians have decided to vote for Atiku Abubakar as the next President of our country and his resort to bitter envy, threats and violence will not change Atiku’s impending victory, insha Allah,” the Campaign added.
