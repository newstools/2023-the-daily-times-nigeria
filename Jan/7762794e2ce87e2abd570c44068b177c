By Tom Garba The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State has called on the electorates to get their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) ready for the victory of party candidates during the forthcoming General elections. Mustapha Ribadu, APC Organizing Secretary made the call while celebrating the victory of Yola-South Local Government party executives at the Appeal Court. He said their PVCs are the keys to APC victory from National down to state assembly elections in the country. “If you can not exercise your right by voting the right people for good governance then you are encouraging bad people to lead the affairs of our country and the state. “And at the end you should not complain about the bad governance that things are not going right. “We have credible candidates; for presidential we have Bola Tinibu, Sen. Aishatu Binani, Governorship candidate, senate positions, members of national and state assembly kindly vote for them for more dividend of democracy”, he said.
